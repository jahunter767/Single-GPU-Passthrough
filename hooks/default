# Copy this file to /etc/libvirt/hooks, make sure it's called "qemu".
# After this file is installed, restart libvirt.
# From now on, you can easily add per-guest qemu hooks.
# Add your hooks in /etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu.d/vm_name/hook_name/state_name.
# For a list of available hooks, please refer to https://www.libvirt.org/hooks.html
